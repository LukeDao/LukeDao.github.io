            <h3>Description</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The game is to be played by two people, with one using the arrow keys to navigate and the other using the WASD keys. 
            The goal is to use your paddle to hit the ball into the other person's wall, which will then give you a point. Once one 
            of the players reaches a score of 10, the game will stop and the winner will be anounced. We coded our game so that when 
            the ball sprite touches the sprite at the other end of the map, the costume of the score will change by one. Randomness occurs
            when we use a random number generator to help contribute to the path of the ball sprite. The game gets more difficult once a 
            second ball appears after a given amount of time.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>My partner and I originally wanted to create a Mario inspired game, but once we saw how complicated it was going to be, we 
            opted out for a somehat simpler game. A few strengths of our creative process included a steady flow of good ideas and a willingness 
            to listen to the suggestions of others. A few problems we encountered included not having enough time and not being efficient with 
            the little time we already had. We overcame these challeneges by working harder both at school and at home. If i had more time, I 
            think I could have be able to make the game more complex, such as by adding specialized maps/levels and possibly even level-ups and 
            health bars. </p>

            <p>This algorithm is for the ball, and it determines the movement of it and what to do once the player scores a point. If the ball 
            is touching the top or the bottom, then it will bounce in a random direction. When the ball hits the paddle, it will glide at a randomly 
            chosen angle. And if it touches the left or right side of the screen, one of the players will gain a point.</p>
